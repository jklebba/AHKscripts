# AHKscripts

This repo contains simple ahk scripts intended to speed up human-computer interaction in Windows and make certain tasks more efficient.

These are some of the more basic scripts from my personal ahk collection, but I use many of them on an everyday basis. My top picks for the general user are **FasterArrowKeys**, **FastBrowserKey**, **FastSearchFiltering**, and **MouseGestures**.
